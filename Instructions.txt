Make sure you have python from the microsoft store installed (newest version)

In case of starting problems, open your cmd as administrator and type in:

pip install pyautogui pytesseract pillow pynput

and also install:

Bug Fixes

Incase of a wrong credit read: make sure your numbers on the bottom right are
easy to, maybe move the mouse a bit.

Incase of the programm not working:

go to line 16 and make sure the path to tesseract is correct.


if it still doesn't work or the path is correct:

go to line 20 and adjust the 4 numbers there, i recommend screenshotting your valorant
putting it into paint.net, the number on the bottom right, you want to select it with the selection
tool, and read the 4 numbers on the bottom left of paint.net, they are your x, y, height and width.

input the new numbers instead.

if it still doesn't work, dm me on Discord: Timerin
